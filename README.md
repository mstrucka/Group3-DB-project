## Installation procedure
Since the database is a MySQL database, you need to have MySQL installed and running on your computer.

Then you need to do the following steps:
- Run ‘ddl-script.sql’ to create the schema and tables.
- Run the scripts with stored objects (routines.sql, events.sql, triggers.sql, views.sql) in any order.
- Run ‘data-inserts.sql’, in order to populate the database.

After completion of these steps, your setup is finished.
